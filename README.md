# Mangrove-Area-Evaluation
Google Earth Engine Code to evaluate Mangrove forest area using vegetative indices 
1. Mangrove Area Calculation:
Data Integration:
Seamlessly integrate satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine into your mangrove area calculations.
Vegetative Indices:
Apply various vegetative indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) for enhanced mangrove discrimination.
2. Decadal Change Assessment:
Machine Learning with Earth Engine:
Harness the power of Earth Engine's built-in algorithms for machine learning, with a focus on the Random Forest classifier.
Temporal Analysis:
Conduct decadal assessments of mangrove area changes using Earth Engine's extensive time-series capabilities.
3. Code Usage:
GEE Script Execution:
Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into the Google Earth Engine Code Editor for seamless execution.
Configurability:
Easily adjust parameters for image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training.
